# Backlog

Ordered; the first item is the current/next task. One item per session — capture
unrelated ideas at the end, don't chase them mid-session. Items below continue
the assurance ladder defined in
[docs/formalisation-roadmap.md](docs/formalisation-roadmap.md); each names its
rung.

## Rung 4 — Protocol-level models

TLA+/PlusCal or Alloy model of the approval + `confirm_unprivileged` policy state
machine: replay impossible, no exec without approval, policy flag transitions
only on an interactive keypress (pins down the F2 / attack-tree leaf 1.4/4.4
residual). Tamarin/ProVerif model of the SSH path to make the channel
assumptions explicit and surface the first-contact MITM gap (attack-tree leaf
4.2 / assumption A4).

## Rung 5 — Deductive verification of the trusted core

Creusot / Verus / Prusti contracts on `validate_request`, the dispatch path, and
the env-allowlist enforcement, proved against the Rung 2 properties. Scope to the
smallest trusted core, not the whole tree.

## Write the CC-structured Security Target document

The remaining Rung 0 / paper step: a Common Criteria Security Target (TOE,
threats, assumptions, SFRs, SARs) consolidating `security.md` / `security-audit.md`
/ `threat-model.md` / `assurance-case.md` into the standard ST structure.

## Stabilize the flaky S2 resource-cap test

`tests/concurrency.rs:burst_connections_above_cap_get_busy_response` fails ~2/3
locally — the *setup* assertion ("in_flight reached ≥4") is timing-flaky, not the
security assertion. Stabilize so the in-flight cap stays covered by CI.

## Make the post-trust banner reliable (F2)

When `confirm_unprivileged=false`, `display_banner` is printed under a `try_lock`
and may be dropped under TTY contention, so silent execution can be invisible.
Make the banner reliable and state the residual risk plainly at the `a`-key
prompt and in the README.

## Rung 6 — seL4-style end-to-end refinement (aspirational)

Long-horizon: prove the daemon's logic refines an abstract approval spec, with
trust assumptions (`/dev/tty`, `sudo`, kernel, SSH) stated explicitly as the
boundary of the proof. Value even unrealised: forces a complete enumeration of
what is trusted-by-assumption.
